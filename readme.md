## Description
Designed two classes to represent the dictionary:
* Binary Search Tree
* AVL Tree

## Implementation
For each dictionary class implemented:
* insertion
* removal
* searching
* display
* destructor

## Tests
Data structures tested with unit tests to check basic functionality.

## Computational complexity
The computational complexity examined for operations: search, insert. Prepared graphs.
